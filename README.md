# ICP-Methods-Comparision
---
Hey, I have made a comparision between all ICP based laser scan-matching methods in detail (including ICP, PL-ICP, NICP, IMLS-ICP):
- You can see my document:   
  ICP-Methods-Comparision/ICP_Methods_Compare.pdf
- The papers I have referenced, please see the folder:  
  ICP-Methods-Comparision/papers
  
- An simple implementation of the method "IMLS-ICP"ï¼Œplease see 
  ICP-Methods-Comparision/imlsMatcherProject
- In future,the Correlative Scan-Matching (CSM) will also be added, to get a robuster pose estimate result.
